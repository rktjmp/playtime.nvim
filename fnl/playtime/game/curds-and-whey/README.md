- You may build sequences of two types,
  - Same suit, descending rank.
  - Different suit, same rank.
- You may combine sequence types in the tableau.
  - E.g. you may move `5, 4, 3` onto `5, 5`.
- You may move either type of sequence but not both at the same time.
  - E.g. you may move `5, 4, 3, 2 of hearts`, or `5, 5, 5 of hearts, clubs, spades`,
    but not `5, 5, 4, 3 of mixed suits`.
- When a sequence of King to Ace, same suit is built, it is removed from the
  tableau, do this for each suit to win.

Note: Davids instructions are unclear as to whether completed sequences are
removed from the tableau (like traditional Spider games) or remain in play
until 4 columns from King to Ace have been created. The Playtime implementation
removes completed sequences which may make the game slightly harder.
