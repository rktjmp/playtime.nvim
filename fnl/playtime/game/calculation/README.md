- There are 4 foundations, which are built up by rank value.
  - The first foundation is built by +1 (A, 2, 3...), the 2nd is built by +2
    (2, 4, 8...), 3rd by +3, 4th by +4.
- You may place cards in one of the 4 tableau columns but you may only move
  cards from the tableau to the foundations. You may not move cards between the
  tableau columns.
