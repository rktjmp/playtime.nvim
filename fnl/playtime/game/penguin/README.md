How to play

See also [Davids description](https://www.parlettgames.uk/patience/penguin.html).

Note: The Playtime implementation always uses Aces as the beak.

- Move all cards from the tableau to the 4 foundations. 3 Aces begin in their
  foundations and the 4th Ace is always buried in the top left of the tableau
  (the beak).
- Build sequences in descending rank, same suit.
- You may move any number of cards at a time if they form a valid sequence.
- You may move single cards to any of the free cells at the top (the flipper)
- You may only move Kings to empty columns.
