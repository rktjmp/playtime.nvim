See [BGG: Optrita:
lines](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2776997/wip-optrita-lines-one-player-trick-taking-game-tra) for more details.

A matrix of 6x6 cards are set. The initial deal has 6 cards face up, SW to NE.

You are dealt 7 cards. You must pick one card to nominate the trump suit, with
6 cards remaining to play during the round.

Place a card at the edge of the GRID to challenge along a row or column, to the
opposite edge. Eg: Placing card on the right edge, row 3, will play from column
6 to column 1, along row 3.

Each card along the challenged line will be flipped *until*:

- The card flipped matches the suit you played, if the card rank (Aces high)...
  - is less than your card, you win the trick
  - is more than your card, you lose the trick.

If no card matches your suit...

- If the line contains any trump suit card, the *lowest* card is used, you lose the trick.
- If the line containes no trump suit, you may pick any card to remove from the
  line, you win the trick.

After 6 rounds, scores are tallied and the GRID is refreshed. Any lines with
only face-up cards are cleared. You are dealt 7 cards and play continues as
before.

Scoring
--

If the GRID scores 11 (or 21 in beginners mode), you lose.

If you score 31 **and** the GRID has **not** scored 11 (or 21 in beginners mode), you win.

Note that scores are tallied *after* a 6-trick round is complete, not mid
round. Its possible to score 31, but lose to the GRID scoring 11 in the same
round.
