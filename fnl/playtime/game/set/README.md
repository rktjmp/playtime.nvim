How to play
--

Each card has 4 attributes, *color*, *shape*, *style* and *count*.

Select 3 cards (a set), where for each attribute, cards have all the same value
*or* all different values. Each attribute is exclusive.

For example, 3 cards where each attribute is:

- red, red, red
- square, triangle, circle
- outline, outline, outline
- 2, 3, 1

is a set. Each color is the *same*, each shape is *different*, each style is
the *same* and each card has *different* numbers of symbols.

Alternatively

- red, red, red
- square, triangle, circle
- outline, outline, outline
- 2, 2, 1

is *not* a set because the count attribute is not all the same, or all different.
